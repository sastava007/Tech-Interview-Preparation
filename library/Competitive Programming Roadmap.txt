🤯 DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

!!!avoid iterative DP if you are a beginner in DP
instead start with recursion and try to memoise the solution.

-> need to be expert in recursion
-> understand memoisation
-> initially solve all the common existing DP problems (LCS, knapsac, etc)
-> solve atcoder educational contest on DP (all 26 questions!)
-> solve problems from various platforms
-> understand how do we write recurrence for digit DP (cf-blog) and solve problems on it.
-> DP with bitmask and solve problems
-> DP on trees
-> SOS DP (cf- blog)


-> disjoint set(using all optimisatios)
-> offline queries using disjoint set (problem: colourful array on SPOJ)(for understanding above topic)
-> Kruskal's algo using disjoint set and solve bunch of problens


-> sparse table (not much important. segment trees do the job)
-> fenwick tree and binary lifting on fenwick tree
   (read about range update trick also)
-> questions on fenwick tree



-> Matrix exponentiation(problems)
-> Sqrt decomposition technique(preferred over segment tree)
-> update and query operations
-> Mo's algorithm (powerful array from codeforces)
-> Mo's algo on trees (long challenges mostly)
-> Segment trees (most importent data structure) (Range queries and point updates)
-> Lazy propagation on Segment trees (range updates)


-> Spraue grundy theorm (SEEN VERY RARE)
-> Flows and related problems (max flow, min flow) (cp-algorithm)
-> heavy-light decomposition on trees 
-> Convex hull algorithm
-> FFT/NTT (any maths blog)
